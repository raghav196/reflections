How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it shows the difference between 2 files.which lines are removed and which lines are added.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    it can show me all the changes that i have done till now.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    google docs automatically commit changes in the file whether they are logical or not therefore having large history.whereas int git we can commit only the logical changes or whenever we feel like.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    to see changes in every file so that the whole code could run properly

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows the different commits we have done.
    git diff compares 2 different commits and shows which lines were added and which wew deleted.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    can find the commit where the bug was introduced.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
